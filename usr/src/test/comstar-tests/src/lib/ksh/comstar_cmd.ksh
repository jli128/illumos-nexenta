#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Run the local command with timeout check mechanism.
#	To prevent the executing command hanging during the testing,
#	the command will be running in backgroup and be checked in loop 
#	by 1 second interval to detect whether it ends. 
#	If exceeds $TIME_OUT,
#	    The process will be killed and the relevant information is saved.
#	Else,
#	    The stdout of command will be save at $CMD_STDOUT file.
#	    The stderr of command will be save at $CMD_STDERR file.
#	    The stdret of command will be save at $CMD_STDRET file.
#
# RETURN
#	stdout, stderr and return value is saved into temporary files
#	void
