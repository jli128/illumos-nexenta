# DESCRIPTION:
#	Online/offline iscsi target port by stmfadm on the target side 
#	without I/O when mpxio is disabled
#
# STRATEGY:
#	Setup:
#		mpxio is disabled on initiator host
#		zvols (specified by VOL_MAX variable in configuration) are
#		    created in fc target host
#		map all the LUs can be accessed by all the target and host 
#		    groups by stmfadm add-view option
#		create target portal groups with one portal per portal group
#		create target nodes (specified by TARGET_MAX variable in
#		    (configuration)  with all the portal groups supported
#	Test:
#		iterate all the target nodes then offline them from 
#		    target host by stmfadm offline-target option
#		sleep 24 seconds
#		check all the target nodes are offline
#		iterate all the other target nodes then online them from 
#		    target host by stmfadm online-target option
#		sleep 24 seconds
#		check all the target nodes are online
#		repeat the online/offline operation for the specified rounds
#	Cleanup:
#		delete all the target nodes
#		delete all the target portal groups
#
#	STRATEGY_NOTES:
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
