/*
 * Saved state for a command that "goes async".  When a compound request
 * contains a command that may block indefinitely, the compound reply is
 * composed with an "interim response" for that command, and information
 * needed to actually dispatch that command is saved on a list of "async"
 * commands for this compound request.  After the compound reply is sent,
 * the list of async commands is processed, and those may block as long
 * as they need to without affecting the initial compound request.
 *
 * Now interestingly, this "async" mechanism is not used with the full
 * range of asynchrony that one might imagine.  The design of async
 * request processing can be drastically simplified if we can assume
 * that there's no need to run more than one async command at a time.
 * With that simplifying assumption, we can continue using the current
 * "one worker thread per request message" model, which has very simple
 * locking rules etc.  The same worker thread that handles the initial
 * compound request can handle the list of async requests.
 *
 * As it turns out, SMB2 clients do not try to use more than one "async"
 * command in a compound.  If they were to do so, the [MS-SMB2] spec.
 * allows us to decline additional async requests with an error.
 *
 * smb_async_req_t is the struct used to save an "async" request on
 * the list of requests that had an interim reply in the initial
 * compound reply.  This includes everything needed to restart
 * processing at the async command.
